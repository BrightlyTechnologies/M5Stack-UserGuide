# M5Stack LORA Module

## DESCRIPTION

The M5Stack LoRa Module is a module with small LoRa module named Ra-02. You can program it after connected to any series of M5Stack Core through Blockly, Arduino or MicroPython.

M5Stack LoRa Module can be used for ultra-long distance spread spectrum communication, and compatible FSK remote modulation and demodulation quickly, to solve the traditional wireless design can not take into account the distance, anti-interference and power consumption

## FEATURES

- LoRa Module named RA-02 supply by Ai-Thinker 
  + Supports FSK, GFSK, MSK, GMSK, LoRa â„¢ and OOK modulation modes
  + Receive sensitivity as low as -141 dBm
  + Programmable bit rate up to 300Kbps
- Build-in Antenna

## INCLUDES

- 1x M5Stack LoRa Module

###*NOTE*

If your board LCD can't display or has some other problem, we suggest you to add the two statements code followed by `m5.begin();` as shown below

```cpp
m5.begin();
pinMode(5,OUTPUT);
digitalWrite(5,HIGH);
```

Because GPIO5 who has connected NSS pin of LoRa module need be pull-up at the moment your board(or system) power on to prevent system's LCD can't display.
